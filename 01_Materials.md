## Step 1: Materials
The first step is to gather the materials you want. These are the materials shown in this guide, but feel free to experiment with other materials. Be mindful of fire risks and be thinking about what hazards you introduce into your home with this kind of project. Always consult a licensed electrician before plugging in mining equipment.  

Everything used for materials on this project was purchased from Home Depot for just under $150.00 USD at the time of writing, January 2022. There are a variety of materials to use for lining the inside of the enclosure. You do not need to use the materials listed here. The reasoning for these specific materials will be discussed below but feel free to experiment and find what works best for you.

The Oriented Strand Board (OSB) was used because it is easy to work with, relatively cheap in the family of plywood materials, widely available, withstands contact with moisture better than plywood, and is stronger than plywood. OSB is not fire rated by default however, consider using a different material if this is a concern.

The asphalt board was used because it is good at noise absorption. Be aware though that asphalt board emits a distinct odor when it heats up and this may not be pleasant or suitable for your living area; more suitable for a garage, shed, or basement. 

The Dense Shield backer board was used because it is a heavy dense material good for blocking noise.

Consider using different materials if you have ideas you want to try out.
